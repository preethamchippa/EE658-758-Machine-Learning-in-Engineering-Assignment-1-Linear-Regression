## Customer Segmentation with Neural Networks and Logistic Regression

### Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for implementing customer segmentation using neural networks and logistic regression. Customer segmentation involves categorizing a company's customer base into distinct groups based on common characteristics such as age, gender, interests, and purchasing behaviors. The goal is to enhance marketing effectiveness by tailoring messages to the specific needs and preferences of smaller, targeted groups.
